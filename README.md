you'll find in the screenshot 'success.png' all the project working in the same time, which is a big proud moment for myself.

in this we're showing the list of employees in 3 different projects (mobile, web, desktop) just the getAll CRUD made here, if i have time i'll continue doing the rest of the cruds, i've done it before in Angular, spring, android studio an JAVAFX but in separated projects with teams, but this challenge is to do the same project by myself .
